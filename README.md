### COMP90049 Project1 Lexical Normalization Based on Tweets
This is the Project 1 for COMP90049 (Knowledge Technologies) from the University of Melbourne.

This project implements three machine learning models, including Na√Øve Bayes, Multinomial Logistic Regression and Random Forest, based on WEKA for tweets sentiment analysis. For more details, please check the [project specifications](https://github.com/Andy-TK/COMP90049_Project2/blob/master/2019S1-90049P2-spec.pdf) and [project report](https://github.com/Andy-TK/COMP90049_Project2/blob/master/COMP90049%20Project%202%20Report.pdf).


#### What is WEKA?
Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. It contains tools for data preparation, classification, regression, clustering, association rules mining, and visualization. Weka also supports deep learning.
